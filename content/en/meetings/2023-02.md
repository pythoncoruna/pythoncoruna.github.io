This month, it's time to speak about: Python Database Basics and Decorators!

We recently hosted an event where we covered the fundamentals of working with databases using Python
and explored the powerful concept of decorators. Participants learned how to interact with
databases, execute queries, and perform common operations using Python. They also discovered how
decorators can enhance the functionality of functions and classes.

Here are the slides used during the event:

- Databases with Python
- [Decorators](/resources/2023/02/Decorators-tech-talk-Python-Coruna.pdf)

Thanks, everyone, for your support and enthusiasm! See you next time!
