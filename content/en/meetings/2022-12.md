Discover the power of the Regular Expressions (RegEx) and the convenience of Poetry!

In the first session, we explored the world of Regular Expressions and shared valuable insights into
their usage. Participants learned how to effectively leverage RegEx to manipulate and validate text
patterns, saving time and effort in their coding tasks.

In the second session, we delved into the Poetry dependency resolver, a powerful tool for managing
Python project dependencies. Attendees discovered how Poetry simplifies package management,
streamlines project setup, and ensures consistent and reliable builds.

Here are the slides used in both sessions:

  TL;DR [PDF](https://mateocpdev.github.io/pdf/poetry/Poetry.pdf)

Thank you to all attendees for making these talks an amazing experience!
