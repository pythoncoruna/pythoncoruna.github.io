We kicked off the series of talks based on FastAPI, an efficient framework for building APIs with
Python.

This first technical talk was composed of the basic concepts about the framework, its origins, the
tools available "out of the box," and the presentation of useful resources.

During the talk, participants were able to dive into the fundamentals of the framework, understand
its evolution, and explore the functionalities it offers by default. Additional resources were
provided to help delve deeper into the topic. This session was an excellent opportunity to acquire a
solid foundation and become familiar with the framework, laying the groundwork for future
developments and explorations in the world of technology.

Many thanks to all the people who attended, and we hope to repeat for the upcoming editions!
