Explore the world of quantum computing and debuggers in our March event!

We had an exciting session where we introduced participants to the fascinating field of quantum
computing. They learned the basics of quantum mechanics, qubits, and quantum algorithms, and
discovered how this cutting-edge technology is revolutionizing the world of computing.

In addition, we delved into the topic of debuggers and emphasized their importance in software
development. Participants learned about different types of debuggers, their features, and how to
effectively use them to identify and fix bugs in their code.

If you couldn't attend the talks, don't worry. Here is the material used:
