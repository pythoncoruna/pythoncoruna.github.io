**Python Coru単a**, as a community which organizes events of several types, wants to ensure that all people who participate in such events or communications have a professional and positive experience of learning, collaboration or leisure. To achieve this, any member who  participates in the community is expected to show respect and courtesy towards others.

By participating in the **Python Coru単a** community, you commit to fostering a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion and/or sexual identity or orientation.

This Code of Conduct details expected behaviors, unacceptable behaviors, and mechanisms to help a person who is experiencing inappropriate behavior.

## Why have a code of conduct?
Continuing with the zen of Python, explicit is better than implicit. Specifying what is expected in the environment at any **Python Coru単a** event:

- Encouraging more people to let them know they are welcome.
- Avoiding ambiguities.
- Building a climate of confidence, where anyone wanting to report an incident will know that we will not start by questioning them (victim blaming).

## Scope
This code of conduct applies to all individuals who participate in **Python Coru単a** community spaces, whether online or offline. It also applies to public spaces where an individual is representing the community. Examples of the latter include using the official email account, postings through official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment for our community:

- Show empathy and kindness towards others. Do not insult or humiliate other attendees. Remember that sexist, racist or discriminatory jokes are not appropriate. They never are.
- Respect different opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Give and accept constructive criticism appropriately.
- Take responsibility and apologize to those affected by our mistakes, learning from the experience.
- Focus on what is best not only for us as individuals, but for the community as a whole.
- Use inclusive language that accommodates a diverse audience.
- Pay special attention to people who are new to the community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual advances or attention of any kind.
- Derogatory (trolling), insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes.
- Public or private harassment.
- Posting others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct that may reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity or religion, pornography in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, unwanted photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwanted sexual attention.

## Compliance
The community administration is responsible for clarifying and enforcing this code of conduct; in the event of inappropriate behavior, it will take the actions it deems appropriate. These range from demanding the behavior to cease, to expelling a person from an event or the Community, without the right to re-entry. The community administration will have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject messages, comments, commits, code, wiki page edits, tickets, and other contributions that do not align with this code of conduct, and will communicate the reasons for its moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting and Contact Information
Cases of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported to the community administrators who are responsible for enforcement:

- If it is an in-person event, you may contact the event organizers directly. They likely have published a specific code of conduct for the event with instructions on whom to contact; they will provide you with a safe space to assist you.
- If it is an online space, contact the moderators of that space.
  - In Telegram, contact the group owner or other administrators.
  - For other spaces or alternatively, contact the Board of Directors at pythoncoruna@es.python.org.

All community administrators are required to respect the privacy and security of those who report incidents.
